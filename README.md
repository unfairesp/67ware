# 67ware - Advanced FPS Utility

67ware is a high-performance, multi-functional utility designed for FPS optimization and gameplay enhancement. Built with a focus on performance and low-latency rendering.

## Security and Safety
Important: Always run the executable through VirusTotal before execution. Due to the nature of low-level system hooks (for recoil and input management), some antivirus software may flag the application as a "false positive." Checking with VirusTotal ensures transparency and peace of mind.
